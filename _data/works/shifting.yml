  My piece is a textural work that explores the use of smaller dynamics to bring out the maximum possible sound of the instrument. 
  The composition was inspired by my previous work, “Time Study in P”, which was composed for a conducting class at the Haute école de musique de Genève. In this piece, certain pitches were derived from the spectral analysis and solution of tam-tam sounds using Orchidea. 
  In my new piece, I aim to synthesize new sounds and construct a “noise” sound as a novel compositional component. I will explore the repetition of textures and how changes in our listening can arise due to these changes. Ultimately, my goal is to create a work that challenges the listener’s perception of sound and encourages them to engage with it in a new way.
