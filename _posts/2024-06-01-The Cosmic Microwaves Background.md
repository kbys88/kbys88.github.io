As part of my collaboration with filmmaker and artist **Robin Touchard**, I contributed sound design and music to the audiovisual installation *The Cosmic Microwaves Background*, presented at **Panorama 26** at Le Fresnoy.

This poetic, immersive installation meditates on cosmic signals and ecological memory. Through a subtle interplay of sound and image, the work explores space, perception, and the invisible traces of the universe's origins.

My sound design involved both composed and generative materials, blending physical and electronic sources to mirror the tension between scientific abstraction and sensorial experience.
