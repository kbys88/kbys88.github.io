Protonwerk is the platform for contemporary music, created by Ensemble Proton Bern. With the support of Swiss Cultural Foundation Pro Helvetia we have been working together to inspire the upcoming generation of composers at the beginning of their professional careers. Those interested can apply to receive a commission to write a new work for one of the annual Protonwerk concerts.
