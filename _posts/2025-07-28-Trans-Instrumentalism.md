**"Day 0 â€“ Trans-Instrumentalism"** is a multidisciplinary performance and musical research project that explores the hybridization of human bodies and instruments through gesture, sound, and technology. Developed in collaboration with IRCAM and Le Fresnoy â€“ Studio national des arts contemporains, the piece interrogates the boundaries between instrumental play, bodily presence, and digital media.

The work is part of a larger reflection on **post-instrumental practices**, where physical gestures and musical intentions exceed the conventional limits of acoustic instruments. It proposes a *trans-instrumental* spaceâ€”a liminal zone where bodies and tools merge, generating an unstable yet intimate musical expression.

The composition integrates:
- **Live electronics** and **gesture-based interaction**
- **Video and visual augmentation**
- A strong dramaturgical axis around **transformation, fragmentation, and hybrid identity**

"Day 0" was premiered in 2024 as part of the **Cursus de composition et d'informatique musicale** at IRCAM, with technical support from the *PÃ´le interprÃ©tation* and collaboration with performer-dancer **[Insert name if needed]**.
