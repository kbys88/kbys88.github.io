This piece was created with a focus on the physicality of the performers and exploring new possibilities in multi-percussion.
At times, the marimba imitates the human voice, blurring the line between performer and listener through a hallucinatory narrative.
This piece was premiered online on March 10th, 2025 by Garrett Mendelow and premiered in France on March 15th, 2025 by Vassilena Serafimova
