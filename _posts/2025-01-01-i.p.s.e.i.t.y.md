<p>
  This piece was created with a focus on the physicality of the performers and exploring new possibilities in multi-percussion.<br>
  At times, the marimba imitates the human voice, blurring the line between performer and listener through a hallucinatory narrative.<br>
  It was premiered online on March 10th, 2025 by <strong>Garrett Mendelow</strong>, and had its French premiere on March 15th, 2025 by <strong>Vassilena Serafimova</strong>.
