In 2023, I was selected as a prizewinner of the **impuls International Composition Competition**, which led to a commission for **Klangforum Wien**.  
My new piece was premiered at the **impuls Festival 2023** in Graz, Austria.

The composition reflects my ongoing interest in **fragility, friction, and temporal rupture**, using extended techniques, micro-interactions, and subtle electronics to create a dense and intimate sonic space.

**Commissioned by:** impuls & AVL Cultural Foundation  
**Performed by:** *Klangforum Wien*  
**Premiere:** impuls Festival 2023, Graz
