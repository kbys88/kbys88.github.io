🎛️ Excited to share my sound design work for the **LIVEN Ambient** synthesizer by Sonicware!

I created original sound presets specially tailored for this new ambient-focused instrument.  
It’s a beautiful synth designed for rich, evolving textures — and I’m honored to have contributed to its sound palette.

A big thank you to **Sonicware** for the opportunity and for their inspiring work in synthesizer design.
