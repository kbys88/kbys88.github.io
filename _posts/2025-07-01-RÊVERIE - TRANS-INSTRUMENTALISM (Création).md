Iâ€™m currently working on a new composition that will be premiered as part of the *Locus Solus* concert series by [Contrechamps](https://www.contrechamps.ch/fr/saison/locus-solus) in Geneva.

This upcoming piece will explore the boundary between instrumental gesture and electronic space, continuing my interest in tactile sonic environments and multilayered temporalities.

Stay tuned for more updates as the work progresses toward its premiere!
